# Cracked
The Cracked app is your closest cooking
assistant. It helps you import recipes from the web, keeping them in one place in an elegant format. Recipes are saved and can be edited. Recipe ingredients can be scaled, converted and sent to your shopping cart when you are ready to head to the store and buy them. This app is for anyone who loves to save recipes for cooking, wants everything to be in one app, or is just tired of looking at millions of ads when looking at recipes online.

## Features
1. Importing Recipes – The user can enter any recipe URL from [allrecipes.com](https://www.allrecipes.com) and the app parses the HTML for the recipe and displays a beautiful version of it in the app.
2. Saving Recipes – Once the user has imported a recipe, it is saved in Firebase, so the user does not have to go looking for it online again.
3. Editing Recipes – The user can edit a recipe to their own liking, and it is updated and saved in the database.
4. Scaling Ingredients – The user can scale the ingredients by 1, 2, or 3 times, in case they wish to make double or triple the original recipe amount.
5. Converting Ingredients – Ingredients can be converted from imperial to metric and vice versa.
6. Shopping Cart – The user can add the ingredients from any recipe to the shopping cart. The shopping cart can then be opened and used as a check off list for when one is shopping for ingredients from the recipes that they want to make.
